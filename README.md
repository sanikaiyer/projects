# Projects Repository

Welcome to my collection of individual projects! This repository serves as the main hub where I organize and showcase all of my work. Each project is stored in its own submodule, which allows me to maintain each project in a separate repository while keeping them all linked in one place.

## Projects Overview

Here are the projects currently included in this repository:
